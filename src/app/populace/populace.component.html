        Flight Populace is expressly interested in making sure every Nimbat and Visitant is healthy, happy, and has the things they need to thrive. 
        Taking up the helm on the more political end of things, this Flight prioritizes on ensuring egality for every inhabitant, and to allow them not only to live, but to pursue some level of happiness. In order for this to occur, systems must be put in place to protect rights and opportunities without it coming to cost another’s. 
        Everyone is allowed to live a free life, but regulations are put in place to make sure no one else’s free life can harm another’s. These sects ensure that this remains true.

                While laws are primarily made by coordination between Flight Populace and the Colony Council, the Flight itself is not within itself a law-making body. Rather, it is a maintenance body. Policies that protect the rights of Nimbats and Visitants are reviewed every year, and public engagement is utilized to make sure that these policies are functioning properly.

                There are circumstances in which a complication arises for an individual that may prevent them from having access to something. In these cases, this sect directly intervenes to provide reasonable assistance. Depending on the service, some level of compensation may be required, but it usually does not completely intrude on one’s life and style.

            <div class="col" style="text-align:justify">
                This particular sect works with Flight Progression to overview new developments for the Colony. These developments could have political changes, and so proposals and coordination with the Council are initiated in order to create necessary policies to accommodate for these kinds of changes, without hurting the political core of the Colony.

        <h5 class="notes">
            "This Elder displays some of the “weakest” magical prowess in the Colony, but that is not to say it is without use. It’s just not evidently apparent, until you put two and two together. Simply put, Jena is an empath, and telepath. She has the ability to read minds to a simple degree, picking up thoughts that permeate through the mind, as well as emotions. The inhabitants say she can figure out an individual in a little under an hour. Jena uses all of this to cater to inhabitants, especially first-time Visitants. She leaves gifts, offers assuring words or advice, seemingly knowing just what to do or say to try and make you smile, or at least feel comfortable. With abilities and a golden heart like that, it’s easy to see why she represents Flight Populace."

                "Ela is quite an interesting specimen. I sought her out, and while many Nimbats said she’d likely be in a certain area of the Colony Center, they also indicated that she rarely ever stopped moving. Upon finally locating her, a throng of other Nimbats swarmed about her, all issuing different requests, giving reports, or providing updates. Throughout this, it became clear Ela was successfully participating in upwards of ten conversations at the same time, not missing a beat between any of them. She, herself, was the conduit for a lot of decision making, and to be honest it was quite impressive to see her work. I elected not to approach closer, as to not distract her further."

                "Rhia was not born in the Colony, making her a very rare figure within the population. However, her experience, drive, and talents that have been developed from existing under those circumstances have made her into a stalwart force that truly made her into an embodiment of “Protect the Weak.” Rhia was born with a unique ability to predict disasters in mere minutes before they actually happen. This does not usually give her enough time to stop it, unless it is something extremely quick. What she normally does is begin allocating resources in advance to prepare for what is about to happen, sending warnings in surrounding areas, and contacting whoever she can within the suspected area to warn others and evacuate safely. In her life outside the Colony, she used this to help others avoid freak accidents. Rhia decided that she wanted to continue helping others, since, while she could predict and mitigate disasters, she was disappointed to see how other civilizations would not aid the victims. Upon entering the Colony, she decided she wanted to do things differently."

                "At first, I would often confuse Jaina for a member of Flight Progression, as her job is closely related to the Flight not of her own. She wears a pair of glasses with large lenses, but upon closer inspection and reports from her coworkers, they’re really just for show. Her eyesight is perfectly fine without them, so I suppose she just likes how they look. She’s the link between Progression and Populace, and is tasked primarily with implementing the discoveries of R&D into the Colony’s lifestyle. I got to speak with her directly, and she was very happy to talk about their latest addition, a newly discovered agricultural technique."
