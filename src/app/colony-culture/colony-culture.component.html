                    by modern understandings, though
                    anthropologists would take quick note of its egalitarian nature similar to the world’s first
                    farmers.
                    Each individual has equal access to the means of survival, but work with emphasis toward their
                    community
                    in order to ascertain that the Colony’s needs are also met. Whether it be learning new magic,
                    cultivating food, or running errands outside of the Colony, they all work towards preservation and
                    general community thriving. In a way, they are not too unlike bees. There are workers, protectors,
                    and a
                    Council that works akin to the Colony’s queen, although the authority is spread out into a
                    representative of each of six Flights rather than one centralized leader. </h5>

                        which lead their own Flight. The Council does not represent a unifying authority body, but it
                        does allow
                        each Flight to coordinate at the deepest level in order to make executive decisions for the
                        Colony as
                        needed. Otherwise, the Council keeps a sense of direction for each Flight, and maintains the

                    <h5>The Colony's citizens are organized loosely into six different Flights, all of which deal with a
                        certain aspect of Colony society. They are as follows: <br />
                        <a class="light-link" href="proliferation">Flight Proliferation</a> focuses on the continuation
                        of the Nimbat species as a whole, through prenatal care and general health maintenance.<br />
                        <a class="light-link" href="protection">Flight Protection</a> is concerned with keeping the
                        Colony in safe hands from both external threats and internal challenges.
                        <br />
                        <a class="light-link" href="preservation">Flight Preservation</a> aims to keep balance in the
                        resources the Colony uses, the life of the forest around them, and the history of the Colony
                        itself.<br />
                        <a class="light-link" href="populace">Flight Populace</a> makes sure every Colony citizen has
                        the services they need to learn and grow.<br />
                        <a class="light-link" href="progression">Flight Progression</a> takes information from the
                        outside world, and works to incorporate it into Colony society.<br />
                        <a class="light-link" href="production">Flight Production</a>ensures the colony runs smoothly by
                        seeing that the proper amount of material goods are provided to everyone.
                        Additionally, there is a small number of Nimbats who choose to exist outside of the traditional
                        Flight structure. They are referred to as "Flightless", however it is understood that is not any
                        sort of insult. Most everyone understands the idea of not wanting to belong to any one Flight,
                        and it is mostly seen as a time for a Nimbat to discover which they would like to end up
                        becoming a part of, if any. Further information on Flights is detailed on the Flight's pages,
                        accessible via the menu or the links above.<br />
