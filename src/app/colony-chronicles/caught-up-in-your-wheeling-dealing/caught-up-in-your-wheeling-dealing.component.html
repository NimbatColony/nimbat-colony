            <h5>You were thankful to see the Sun dip past the crowd of trees. It brought you some much-needed shading in the open field where you worked. When you weren’t plucking grapes off the vine, you were busying yourself with the more tedious task: lifting and carrying. Your co-workers could only handle smaller weaved baskets to transport fruit from the canopy to the processing squads, given the fact that the workers were composed entirely of small cat-like winged creatures. Some of them could only stand just past your waist. A rare few could actually meet your chest. You remembered a time where not so long ago, you were far more perplexed by these creatures. The different color schemes they were born into, the variety of magical talents they boasted, and the massive operation that they’d been running long before you were conceived. Now, you’re stepping in as a helping set of hands. Some of the Nimbats could lift large baskets with their very minds if they had the energy, but those sorts weren’t exactly in high supply and the Colony had hundreds of hungry mouths. This part of the farmlands you were aiding was just that. A part. A sector to occupy a particular crop, while others tended to other fields that sustained another source of the dietary needs of the inhabitants that walked by you, as well as those that were in the Colony proper.</h5>
<h5>
Needless to say, most were thankful that you opted to put your arms to service. You could carry the larger baskets in one hand as long as there was a handle you could grip. So, you’d be the one walking just half a mile with two bucket-sized things in both hands, carrying the weight of a whole bunch of grapes and then walking on back to collect some more, while your feline compatriots moved through the air above you with smaller containers. They moved faster with their wings—that’s just a given. You weren’t so worried about that. The only real complaint you had was that some of the flyers were a bit too hasty in their work, making some of the fruit drop down on your head like tiny, softer pieces of hail. You managed to smile at it even after the fifth time your cheek was prodded by the single drop of a grape, but your patience could only be stretched so thin. Nevertheless, you’d been at this for about seven hours now. Seven? Truth be told, you didn’t have a watch strapped on you, and your phone had died a good while ago. One of the farmers actually knew some electrokinesis, but you weren’t willing to gamble the functionality of your phone for the sake of seeing if a quick zap would charge your battery enough to check the time. No matter how long it’d been taking, you were feeling the pang of exhaustion quite a while ago. You weren’t running on fumes, of course. This arrangement wasn’t a thankless job. You were given water, lemonade, a helping of snacks to keep your sugar up, a promised meal, and a helping of coin to fancy yourself however you’d like after your work’s completion.</h5>

<h5>“How’re you holding up?”</h5>

<h5>Your head turned to the right. You’d heard a distinct disturbance in the air, resulting from a telltale beating of wings pushing against the space to make someone’s descent slow to a comfy halt. This was accompanied by the sound of wool brushing up against itself. Beside you walked Kara, minding where she had landed to make sure you didn’t need to adjust your pace to keep yourself from bumping into her. You couldn’t see her entire face thanks to her white, wool poncho, but you saw her smile crease across her short, adorable muzzle. Your reply was earnest, but tied with a truly tired pitch. Kara’s wings tucked into her back while she edged her head over towards one of the dangling baskets balanced by your gripping hand. Her hues scanned over the green bounty that relied entirely on you to get to the cleaners. “You’ve done excellently,” she said, with a pinch of sugary warmth that reminded you of a jovial old lady that worked the office at your middle school. “I think I’m going to call it here. This’ll be your last delivery, then you can take a much-needed load off.” She patted you just above your waist, brushing a bit of dirt and dust on your tank top. For a moment she looked apologetic, but one glance up at your tired but smirking expression informed her that she needn’t fret over it. Honestly, Kara was one of the sweeter bosses you’ve ever worked with in your life. Her scheduling was flexible, her repayment made you feel appreciated, and she was quick to resolve any problem that occurred on the fields. Let’s face it: she’s forgotten more about plant care than you could ever know. If you could provide any real input, you just might ask her to be mindful of when she decides to sprout a couple daisies wherever she sat or stood. Her flowers were nice, but the sudden burst of phytogenesis often caused an annoying helping of pollen to wind up in your nostrils and eyes.</h5>

<h5>Your destination was a bustling wooden pavilion. There were piles of baskets sitting by one of the ending tables, and it was fairly easy for you to pick apart which ones were yours given their size. Three Nimbats were scouring through them, sorting each and every individual grape for any worrying sign that suggested something more than just dirt having gotten on the chewy surface. Once they were cleared, they’d be conveyed to other Nimbats that’d give them the cleanup before prepping them for the market. The moment your final baskets were dropped, it felt like the weight of the world poured out of your arms, allowing your shoulders to start detensing and your diaphragm to relax. You looked at your hands. You’re shocked you didn’t get even a single splinter on you, but the signs of callous skin and irritation were well-painted on your palms and the roots of your fingers. A satisfied sigh rang out through your chest. You didn’t need to linger here to wait for anyone, so you meandered to the other side of the pavilion, riding along the space where the shade of the roof paralleled the bright of the Sun. You listened in on the chattering of the workers as you walked on, picking up on the tiniest of words that suggested even the slightest ounce of gossip. Some complained about the state of the larger world. You caught the sweet humming of a young tom washing some grapes, completely zoned out from everything else and working in a rhythm that only he could flow with. It was fast enough to be productive, at least.</h5>

<h5>At the other end, there were tables with little cups and large pitchers of lemonade. Granola bars were laid out on little napkins, separated by their flavors and contents. While you grabbed at a cup—a bit smaller than what you were used to at home—you looked up at the pair of batcats conversing on the other side of the table. The first was a notably larger sort, tall enough to make her nose touch the bottom of your sternum. She was decorated in a warm mix of maroons and reds, and the fur on her jowls had stuck out a little. Now, this one you’ve seen before. A real womanly-shaped creature that’d been right where you were looking at her, just two hours ago. She’d barely moved from her spot. Sometimes, when you’d deliver the grapes, you’d find her sitting on a chair. Other times you’d find her talking with another Nimbat like she was now. But each and every single time? You’d swear she was sizing you up when you weren’t looking. The second Nimbat looked a bit more plain, save for the belt of gardening tools that looped around her waist. She was shorter, and thinner than the other. Your eyes peered at both of them for a spell while you sipped at your lemonade, trying not to draw attention to yourself before you turned to a split in the trees that led into the Colony’s center. Placing your cup by a discard pile, you let your weary legs start carrying you onward. But then, just as the tip of your right foot slipped beyond the shade, you felt an impossibly soft paw momentarily press upon your shoulder. Heat laced itself into your skin. Not a burning kind of heat like what you’d been working in earlier, but something toastier. Something that warmed your very soul. You very nearly stumbled in your next words as you turned to see who needed you. It didn’t exactly surprise you to see that it was the reddish Nimbat that provoked your attention, but something about affirming your lingering wonders did make you feel…something. Who was she, and what did she want?</h5>

<h5>“Ah, finally! I didn’t want to interrupt you while you were helping our busy bees. It’s nice to finally see you. Do you have a name I can call you by, Visitant?”</h5>

<h5>Your lips opened, on the verge of joking to her and saying that she’d already named you ‘Visitant.’ You might’ve gone through with it if you didn’t notice that her pinkish-purple hues were directly locked onto yours. Her gaze was by no means intimidating, yet you could barely sustain a shudder through your spine. Her paw didn’t tear away from your shoulder, even when you’d turned to face her. Her pads were pressed into you, trying to feel past your skin and get a hint of the muscle underneath. Did she…want something? You picked up some amount of desire behind the windows of her soul, but something told you it might not be a great idea to confront her. So you gave her what she asked for, and her gaze broke with a close of her eyes as a melodious giggle streamed out from her throat. “Anon,” she repeated. Hearing your name in her voice was far different than anything you’ve ever felt. It was like she had practiced her tone, knowing just how to make it sound like she was beckoning you, even though she was literally touching you. “I am Rosmerta. I hope the Agriculture sect has been kind to you?”</h5>

<h5>Rosmerta. Now your guard was shattered without any hope of repair. The Elders of the Colony didn’t go out of their way to go and greet every visitor, they were busy managing their respective Flights and their operations. Meeting any of them usually fell under some kind of business-related ordeal, if it wasn’t a more casual meetup. Their names were one of the first things you learned on your first visit to the Colony. Before you stood the Proliferation Elder, sizing you up and greeting you like you were an esteemed student. Her paw left your shoulder, only to slip down your arm, stopping just behind the elbow. Her pressure was the same, pushing straight into the muscle that’d been building while you worked at the fields. You tried to momentarily escape your situation, shifting your head to try and look past the motherly Nimbat to glance at the gardener she was speaking to not seconds before all of this. All you received was a smirking face, followed by a raising paw coming up to successfully hide a giggle. There was no savior in sight. Not that you were in any danger, as far as you knew—there was just so much heat accumulating within you. You felt like bursting. Was she praising you? Judging you? What was her gain? What was her game? Inhaling, you tried to conjure up a word or two, but you could only find the resolve to nod your head at her inquiry. Rosmerta didn’t skip a beat, while you were struggling to even figure out what song she was stepping to. “Oh, I would love to have you as company. Surely your schedule is open for the rest of the day, if you aren’t so tired? You’re welcome to use my showers, my esteemed Anon.~ You’re rather tense… Cold water often helps with even the tiniest inflammation under the skin, you might find it soothing.” Her limb finally returned to her side, leaving only her aura to maintain its attacking position on you. Slowly, she was warming you up…</h5>

<h5>How could you tell her no? A declination didn’t even strike any part of your thinking brain. You mustered up another nod, followed by a spoken agreement. Rosmerta didn’t grab at you, thankfully. Instead, she took the lead in front of you, walking toward the dirt path at a casual pace, not bothering to fly and make you walk any faster than your own desired speed. You followed along, letting whatever lay in your peripherals fade out of focus…</h5>

<h5 style="text-align:center">- - -</h5>

<h5>One of the toughest things for Progression to figure out how to implement from the outside world was the shower. The Colony quickly found the benefits of its usage over the traditional baths, but trying to craft and engineer things like faucets and water heating and cooling systems went against an entire series of teachings. It took some creative innovation to make it happen, and you were experiencing what came of it. The shower that you had access to had only one temperature setting, sitting more around the colder end of things. Not nearly enough to make your spine tense, but it was fine enough to begin telling your body to slow down and relax. Water came from a kind of localized stream, sort of like a tiny waterfall. Wooden dividends and openings allowed clean water to drop in a spread form, ensuring it would drench your body from head to toe. It wasn’t out in the open, either. Stalls were covering you on all sides, keeping your sacred body hidden away from the cruelty of the world. In little makeshift shelves, you had a selection of closed pot-like containers tucked away from the stream, save for the one you’d just opened up to show you how Nimbats made fur care products. The oily, cream-colored substance within reminded you of chapstick that’d been left out in the heat, all melted and slimy. It smelled sweet, and hardly overwhelming. Try as you may, you couldn’t match the scent to anything else you knew about. When you dipped your fingers into the stuff and slathered it on your hair, you were relieved to find that it didn’t stick or settle in clumps; it only spread thinner, and thinner, and thinner, washing over the most singular strands of hair on your head. It wasn’t too far off from the shampoo you were used to back home.</h5>

<h5>This was Rosmerta’s personal shower. For someone like her, this arrangement actually seemed fairly modest. It wasn’t too far off from the other stalls that were scattered about in the Colony. You were thankful it was sized enough to accommodate your body’s approximate area and give you enough wiggle room to let your thoughts fill the space you weren’t covering. You knew full well Rosmerta wasn’t solely doing this out of the kindness of her heart. The Elders had varying levels of generosity, each one able and willing to provide at a moment’s notice, but you didn’t truly believe you were just going to walk out of this shower and head back home immediately. You thought back to when the two of you were walking toward the Proliferation complex. It seemed plain enough on paper. You told her about yourself, she shared some details about her lengthy life, she laughed when you threw a compliment her way. You tried to stay humble and tell her that you were just another Visitant happy to lend a helping hand, but she made you feel like more than just that. She boosted you up without even directly complimenting you and your work. You’d always thought the Elders maintained a stronger and “regal” personhood. They led the Colony, after all. Their vision was what allowed this entire civilization to keep running. You didn’t feel like a cog or a pawn in any of this, but you couldn’t claim that you were a particularly large piece on the Colony board. Yet, Rosmerta was far more casual and sweeter than you might’ve predicted. Less like a queen, or a member of a government council, and more like…a mother. You smirked to yourself. Really, you should’ve seen that coming.</h5>

<h5>You turned a large switch to the opposite end, and the water was plugged up. Only drips and tiny sputters rained down on your body, and cold moisture clung to your body. You opened the door, and the air of the secluded, fenced-off space rushed in to attack you. The drying atmosphere tingled your body, and you quickly grabbed at the towel hanging on the front of the stall door to rid yourself of the dampness that had begun to feel uncomfortable. You stepped back into the stall and finished up in under a minute. You heard a knocking at the door leading inside the burrow-like building in front of you. Rosmerta’s voice called, “Hello! I decided to have your clothes cleaned while you were washing up. I have them right here.” You’d actually forgotten about your garbs after you stepped into the water. But…weren’t they sitting on a rock? She probably grabbed them without you noticing while you were occupied under the shower. Deciding not to think too much about how she very nearly invaded your privacy, you made sure the towel was nice and snugly wrapped around your waist before opening up the wooden door by a couple of cracks. You saw the maroon Nimbat on the other side, holding out your apparel all neatly folded and relieved of the dirt that wore on you earlier. The door closed with a tug from the other side, and you slipped everything on with relative haste. You were still under the impression that the Elder was waiting on you, after all.</h5>
<h5>
It took you a little under three seconds to steel yourself before you opened the door…only to find no one in your sight. Not in front of you. Not to your left. At your right, Rosmerta was looking over a pamphlet of some kind, peering over some text through a tiny pair of glasses sitting on the bridge of her nose. Right, you thought. She was still trying to play it casual-like. But knowing how she could be even in the most plain of meetings, how would she seem when she was acting with a drive? Her head glanced at your position, and she welcomed you with her winning smile. “Hm.~ My dashing young man,” she teased, venturing right over to you. Before you knew it, she’d taken up a new approach on your person, touching you with her front instead of with her heated mitts. Despite your sizes, you felt the soft, squeezable heft of her stomach push into yours. Her thighs played over your knees, and her paws were holding onto your sides. Your arms moved in on impulse, to grab at the womanly batcat’s waistline as both of your forms went flush with one another. It’d already happened by the time you even realized it. Rosmerta purred, “Ooh.~ Excellent aim, dear. I suppose that brushes a couple of questions out of the way…” You watched as she tried sitting up some, weighing down your stomach as she began to incline on you, trying to reach your face. While the sensation of her fluffy, plush frame spilling out over your body felt nothing short of amazing, you didn’t want to have to get down on your back while standing. You let your knees bend just enough to lower your height. The tip of your nose touched the little tuft of maroon fur on her head, moving down the middle of her face, and then halting when it touched her adorable snout. The Elder beamed, and pressed her upper lip into your own. “You’re nothing short of wonderful, Anon. If you don’t mind spending away the rest of the day with me…I’d love to have you by for a spot of intimate company. Perhaps, get to know you deeper than most, and enjoy each other to the highest degree.~” Her words poured into your mind like syrup, clouding over your thoughts and stifling your focus. You felt your toes curl. You felt blood leave your fingers, to supply the stirring organ that’d been slumbering in your undergarments…</h5>
<h5>
Alright, you’re game. You took up a bolder resolve, and stole a kiss from Rosmerta to show your enthusiasm. Or maybe, you just did it to try and test reality. You’d heard many things about the skilled illusionists that roamed the Colony, hiding it from the outside. Who’s to say they weren’t playing a prank on you? You couldn’t think of any other way to find out other than embracing the matronly Nimbat in your arms, and giving her the traditional lover’s kiss. Your mouth met with hers, and warmth channeled past your tongue. You could taste her. Smell her. No…this wasn’t an illusion. You just straight-up kissed the Proliferation Elder. The woman mewled into your maw, and played with your bottom row of teeth with a drag of her silky tongue. She toyed with you for just a moment, before she parted her mouth from yours and took a single step away, watching you with raw excitement. “To my chambers, Anon. This way.”</h5>
<h5>
To this day, you haven’t quite figured out how air conditioning worked indoors here. Cooler temperatures welcomed you in the moment you followed after your Elder guide through the thick oakwood door, ducking by a touch to avoid being scraped by the frame of the somewhat oval-shaped entryway, and the soothing chill just washed over you like an embrace. Likely, it could’ve been magic. You haven’t seen wire nor filament during your many visits…though, rumors have conjured up in your mind once or twice about their existence in Acquisitions. Thousands of things here could be written off thanks to the touch of arcane, and you would never be able to see any actual trace of it. At least what you couldn’t see was probably still on your side. There was a lot more to explore given the room you just entered, after all.</h5>
<h5>
You’ve never actually been in the Proliferation complex before. The inside made the branching structures look a lot more seamless, and markings scattered the walls and wooden ceiling-signs to tell your eyes just what led where. The flooring was clean, and a few pots containing ferns and flowers sat in the corners of what reminded you of a waiting room. Seats and cushions lined up the walls, but there weren’t as many as you might see in an ER. There weren't even nearly as many inhabitants to be likened to one. All you saw was this orange-ish batty sitting with one leg over the other, right next to a tiny table with a little cup of something you couldn’t discern. She tilted her head up from a book that fit in her mitts, stared at you for all of two seconds, and then flashed a toothy grin. Your face flared up in blush. She didn’t need to explain herself, and neither did you. There was only one other person that came here before you, and mostly everybody in the complex knew just who she was. The one just moments from turning a corner in a hallway leading out of the waiting room. Her red and maroon body produced a gait that was designed to make your heart stir. Round, firm hills hung and gently bounced in a rhythm that demanded your attention, clinging to a whole set of breeding handles that moved like rolling waves at the beach, slow but powerful. Her legs weren’t too distanced from each other, denying you from seeing everything else you wanted to see. Her ass was closed, making a fat line that ran from the base of her raised tail to the backs of her thighs. Above this, her sides supported what you now understood to be lady handles. How else could you describe them? They were perfectly shaped for the grip, to brace yourself onto when your body would clash with hers. If she sat in your lap, there’s a real chance she could cover past your legs with what was bouncing and swaying just in front of your vision. Oh, if only you hadn’t lagged behind.</h5>
<h5>
You were busy distracting yourself with stupid things. Your heart had been racing harder than it had when you’d been running up and down the river yesterday, and you could only produce anxiety that could barely be treated by thinking about anything else, no matter how dumb, like the ramifications of the air conditioning that first greeted you when you came here. Now, you’re chiding yourself for letting yourself slow to crawl and keeping your company waiting. The outright beautiful sight had slipped past the wall to the right, and you picked up the pace in your trembling legs. Before you could reach, the woman returned, poking her head out from the corner to bedazzle you with her soft gaze. Her creamy paw rested against the wall next to you, curling and dragging over the surface, intentionally positioned just past your reach. Rosmerta’s warm look grew, as her short muzzle greeted you with a smile that made you feel all the more at ease. “Hmm? Oh, did I walk too briskly? I must’ve let my own excitement overreach me. Here, let’s not lose each other…”</h5>
<h5>
She stepped further beyond the corner and reached out to settle her pawed hand right into the palm of your own. Heat spilled out into your fingers, and up your wrist. Slowly, you made your best attempt to hold her by the limb. Your teeth grit together on the middle of your tongue to keep yourself from gasping. Your felt color splash over your face, and for a moment you wondered if the both of you could be just as red as the other. The Elder was the first to tug, and you clung onto her paw, letting her take you away from the grinning gaze of the other Nimbat that’d been watching you the whole time. Your step worked to match with Rosmerta’s, trying not to go too fast or too slow—an effort that made the womanly creature giggle with a sweetness that made your mouth tingle. You looked up and saw just where she was presumably taking you to. The door was partly open, obscuring just half of your view from where you stood. The room inside was coated in a thick layer of dark, but the illumination from where you were walking was allowing you to see a brown, thick rug that sat under a bed-like mass covered in purple sheets. You felt Rosmerta’s tail flick at the back of your calf before it snaked past your glutes and ran up the back of your top, tickling the crease of the bottom of your spine. You couldn’t wait anymore.</h5>
<h5>
Neither could she. Her paw gripped you tighter, and she tugged you past the door in one motion. Her leg bent back to kick the door closed. Then, she immediately slipped an arm under your tank top, openly gliding up your stomach and feeling up your rattling chest. Feeling your nervousness pulse through your thoracic made her giggle. “What, is this your first time with a Nimbat? Have you thought about making love to us before?” You couldn’t muster up the focus to think about that, for she had begun fiddling with the front of your shorts. They went down to your ankles in moments, and her mitts began doting upon the unmistakable tent that’d pitched itself in your boxers. They were so cozy and loose just before Rosmerta had began her aggressive flirting, but now you felt utterly imprisoned. You felt your knees tremble.</h5>
<h5>
Rosmerta tugged at the stretchy hem that hugged at your waist. “It’ll be alright, sweetheart. I’m going to take good care of you.~” Gulping, you lifted one leg after the other as she slid your boxers down, past the knees and through the ankles. You had nothing left to hide, below your waist. Your proud mast pointed straight at her, throbbing with life, tensed up like a stone as blood pooled into the muscles within. “Have you been building up just for me~?” Her teasing tone rang out as she cupped the underbelly of your dick, pushing up underneath to see just how heavy it was. She did the same to your sack below, careful not to disturb the rotund thing as she tested to see just how much you had to offer. “So thoughtful of you.” You watched, feeling a knot build up in your throat as she brought her lips to hover just in front of the head of your prick. She didn’t touch you with anything but the venting heat of her breath, exhaling onto your sensitive, swollen surface and causing you to throb once more. Clear droplets of pre-seed dribbled from your opening, and Rosmerta finally entreated you to the wonder of her tongue by flicking under your tip, collecting your arousal to spread out along her taste buds. “You’re nearly bursting at the seams! It’s a good thing I found you in time.~”</h5>
<h5>
Away she went, moving toward the purple-sheeted bed. In your shaky demeanor, you grabbed at your shirt and yanked it off of your body. Rosmerta had already climbed up onto the foot of the conjoined cushions on all fours, moving her luxuriously-shaped rump in front of your vision. Her tail was nice and tucked in the cleavage between those red-colored cheeks, hiding away what you’d be dealing with in due time. “Now, take your time to get familiar with me…” Her tail arched up and out of the way, giving you your first taste of indecent exposure. Everything was laid out before you. Below her tail sat a clean, pinkish, slightly puffy hole. Stretchy-looking, just by the mere sight of it. Stretchy, yet tight. Despite the spread on her legs, her backdoor was barely opened to you. Below that was her folds, plump like a bud, and keeping back a bit of moisture within. You got up close and personal, pressing your forehead into the comfy cushion of her ass while you pried her flower apart with your thumbs, showing off the juices that stretched from one wall to the other like a bridge. Her insides flexed and tightened down on themselves, trying to invite you to dive in and become hopelessly lost in her tunnel.</h5>
<h5>
It’s not like you had any plans to do anything else. Your digits dug in past the outer labia to tease the front wall of her vent, making her squeal in approval. You thumbed about in there, testing just how much girth she was designed to handle. “Hnaaah.~ Oh, Anon… Please, lie down for me.” Fine. But you weren’t going to let her off easy. With such an open view of her vagina and everything surrounding it, you bid your farewell by pressing your tongue up against her clitoral hood, earning you a delighted yelp from your bedmate. When you pulled away, you looked on over to see Rosmerta trembling on the sheets and grabbing at her own rear. You found yourself grinning. Now, you could climb onto the bedding and start treating this kitty to a night she deserves, where she’d surely fill the air with shouts of your name. Your hand grabbed at her shoulder, but before you had any chance to get some leverage and pin her down for the romp, she suddenly lifted her whole frame and delivered her reversal by shoving her mitts onto your chest and forcing your head down into the nearest pillow with a heavy kiss. You writhed underneath, and grabbed at her thighs the moment they draped out across your prone body. Your cock pulsed against her soft tummy, giving you a good hint to how far up her abdomen you could get in there.</h5>
<h5>
“Mmn, mmn… I said I would take care of you, didn’t I? Hold on to me, dear. Relax yourself… And please, finish inside.~” Oh. You hadn’t even thought about that, but hearing her openly affirm it made your cheeks flush. You were going right back to turning into putty in her paws. So, you held on to her legs while she happily took control, lifting her fertile hips and skillfully kissing the crown of your cock with her honeypot. The exchange made you sharply inhale. You watched in awe as she took what was hers, pushing down on your cock and engulfing it right in front of you. Inch after inch disappeared into her cooch, surrounding you from all sides with hot, squelching, drenching walls that hugged around you and pulled on your skin.</h5>
<h5>
Your own legs spread and your bottom jaw began to droop in a stupor of pleasure, and she kept taking more and more until her labia touched the bottom of your base. You saw a fine protrusion in her stomach, but it wasn’t remotely big enough to be worrying. Grunting, you shifted underneath the motherly batcat, pressing your head up into what felt like her squishy, tight cervix. Rosmerta purred, and bent down took up your neck in both her arms while her lips brushed and grazed along yours. “Move with me, Anon. Hold onto me, and let it all fall into place…~”</h5>
<h5>
Fuck, she’s already too much. You took a deep breath, and let her face relax against yours as she began to move. You could no longer see anything going on at your loins, now that the Elder’s sweet expression blocked your sight. You felt her cunt drag over your member, glazing your surface with her juices. Her tight folds moved up your cock, pulling up to the middle before moving back down. You’d match her beat, rolling your hips up into hers to help drive your tool up into her limits, time and time again. She didn’t try to go much faster than a canoe on a leisurely swim at a lake, and neither did you. Euphoria washed over your core as you let the moment sink, moving in a hypnotic trance of passion and intimacy.</h5>
<h5>
You let your thoughts drift, focusing only on the sensations that rippled along your body. The tug and squeeze of her womanhood, the wet sounds of your moistened organs and dampened hips clashing again and again, the sweet gasps and mewls that surged from your Elder partner… Her hot breath traded with yours, and occasionally she’d deliver a lazy kiss on your parted lips. Up and down she bounced, picking up speed for five-second bursts to stimulate the both of you, and then slowing herself down to ensure the pleasure train lasted long enough to be enjoyed to its fullest. Your body pushed up into hers to join her in the tandem that you could only describe as love-making.</h5>
<h5>
“F-Finishing soon?” You were. It felt like you’d been going at this for an hour, thrusting at each other to balance the both of you between pleasure and release. Try as you might, it just wasn’t possible to keep it that way forever. Tension overtook your balls, and you felt your veins seize up all at once. Closing your eyes, you dug your fingers into her pillowy thighs and amplified your movements with the full intent of seeding her with a proper end. Her moans did fill the room like you’d hoped, and it just provoked you to keep going. You barraged your spear against the ends of her sex, punching her pleasure button over and over, all so that you could bring her to the edge. It worked wonders. Her walls squeezed down on you like a vice of flesh, and she showered your dick with a splash of her juices. That had to be plenty to send you to the climax, so you grabbed the back of her head and pulled her in for another kiss. The fur on her cheeks tickled your face, but compared to the wave of bliss shooting up your loins, it felt numb. You captured her mouth and fought against her moans with your own, all while you pumped shot after shot of your batter up into her depths, aiming to splatter and paint everything pink in a sea of off-white. You felt your own seed dribble down your dick, out from her squeezing cunny, threatening to spill out past your groin and make a mess on the cushions below.</h5>

Rosmerta gasped through her nose and escaped the kiss. Her right mitt held onto your cheek while her left pulled you by the shoulder. Now you were face to face after a slow, firm twist. Somehow you’d managed to remain hilted inside, nice and settled in her clenching, trembling tunnel. She held you nice and close, moving one of her legs to lazily hang over your waist while you idly pumped a few more ropes of spunk into her body. Exhaustion didn’t take over just yet—you were spent, but not tired. After all, the Nimbat did most of the moving while you simply followed along. Rosmerta shakily moaned, and began peppering a few kisses on your lower jaw. “Y-You’re full of delights… Haah…~ My, you’ve spilled so much,” she muses, brushing her snout into the cleavage between your chin and your bottom lip. You reached behind, to pet over her back—mindful of her wings, of course—and cup at her butt. “Mmnh.~ With a confident output like that, I’m wondering if it might’ve taken!” …Why did she have to say that? Thinking about that possibility brought forth energy, and your cock pulsed in her sex as it began revving up all over again. Rosmerta felt it, and gave you a toothy smile of knowing. “Oh, you poor boy. Let’s try again, just to make sure it worked.~”</h5>
