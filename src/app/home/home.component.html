    <mat-card>Primarily from the notes of Nimbat researcher █████████, this site is a transcription of the details
        included in their extensive notes on the Nimbat species, and the Colony they reside in. There are plenty of
        readable portions of the book, though many more are currently illegible. A team of researchers are working to
        restore the pages, and the ones that are currently readable are archived here. As more pages become accessible,
        and more research is conducted, more will be added. Throughout the accounts, the researcher leaves a few
        personal notes, detailing their specific interactions with certain parts of the Colony itself.

        It is recommended that only adult researchers access and use this site. Navigating from this page implies you
        understand that this site is for adults only.
