            <h5>Nimbats are small, winged, felid-like creatures. They can grow to be anywhere between 1 to 4 feet tall,
                from base of the foot to tip of the ear. Their wingspans are composed of a membranous tissue, similar to
                bats. They tend to be proportionate to their bodies by other species' standards. They have a total of
                seven appendages- Two arms, two legs, two wings, and a tail. There are 4-5 fingers on each hand, and 3-4
                toes on each foot. Paw pads akin to cats exist on the bottoms of their feet, and the palms of their
                hands. Their ears are tall and wide. Nimbats tend to live for a very long time; while they develop
                similar to humans when it comes to maturation cycles, their actual lifespan has an unknowable length.

                "I’ve personally met a number of self-proclaimed millennia-old Nimbats, who don’t seem to be much
                physically older than those who have been alive for no more than 20 years. I’m unsure if I’ll ever know
                exactly how they work, as Nimbats seem to “dissolve” once they pass away, making dissection practically
                impossible."</h5>

            <h5>
                Their eyes are most often pupil-less, a convex “sparkly” iridescent iris instead fills the eye. It tends
                to consist of a gradient of color, from anywhere from blue, to green, to red. This doesn’t mean they’re
                blind, they seem to be completely aware of all visual stimuli, and are able to navigate well.
            </h5>
            <h5>Additionally, Nimbats who happen to lose parts of their bodies report that their lost parts sparkle and
                dissolve into the air, and the body that is left behind begins to heal immediately, slowly sealing the
                wound and stopping blood from escaping. However, they’re unable to regrow limbs, and often turn to magic
                to augment themselves if they find themselves in that situation.</h5>
