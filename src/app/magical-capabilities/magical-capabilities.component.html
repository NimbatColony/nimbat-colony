                        Every Nimbat has innate magical capabilities and a connection to the arcane, but how that
                        capability
                        manifests varies wildly from Nimbat to Nimbat. They report that their magic can take any form,
                        and it is
                        up to the Nimbat themselves to determine how they would like theirs to manifest. They describe
                        it as a
                        sort of “focusing.” They choose to learn about and improve upon the arcane aspects that interest
                        them
                        the most and are within reach, usually as they pertain to their personal hobbies and interests.
                        Through
                        training and understanding, a Nimbat can craft and weave together different schools of magic
                        that
                        exemplify their ability and expression. For example, Nimbats can be powerful illusionists—a
                        large
                        network of them hides the colony from the outside world. To become one, all a Nimbat would have
                        to do is
                        study it, train in it, and their magical focus slowly begins to change. It’s very possible for
                        Nimbats
                        to learn multiple schools of magic rather than just settling for one, but it is not
                        highly-sought after.
                        It is sometimes compared to learning a new language with different rules than the root. </h5>
                    <h5>It is perfectly possible for Nimbats to forgo magic altogether, although these examples have
                        been observed to be exceedingly rare.</h5>
                    <h5>
                        Recorded observation of multiple Nimbat specimens led to the following list of known Nimbat
                        magic. It should be noted that this is not an exhaustive list, as it seems the Nimbat species
                        will more often “riff” on magics to make them more individualistic.

                            were to touch it. The question is, would it not be so obvious that an enchantment was
