                    farmers that keep the whole colony moving together.

                            This sect focuses almost entirely on the production
                            of crops. Whether it be for food or materials like cotton, the farmers and gatherers are the
                            lifeblood of Agriculture for the Colony. Crops are inspected, and those working on the
                            production and maintenance of these crops are compensated accordingly. There are also
                            systems proposed and practiced by this sect in order to protect food security in moments of
                            disaster or destruction.

                            A majority of the workers in Metallurgy are focused on extracting and refining material from
                            the Colony’s mine, as well as those more interested in processing metals for tools and other
                            uses around the Colony. What’s most interesting is that while the mine itself isn’t very
                            rich in ore, the Nimbats that deploy their magics for alchemy are able to transmute stone
                            and other procured items from the mines into potential ore. From there, smelters and forgers
                            are able to process that metal into usable material. They work closely with Preservation’s
                            Maintenance sect, providing them with material that may be needed to retain infrastructural
                            integrity for buildings and other projects.

                            Handicraft is home to the makers, the movers, the shakers, and the improvers that actually
                            produce the things made from raw material found in its sister sects. Carpenters, weavers,
                            goldsmiths, leatherworkers, blacksmiths and more find themselves at-home in this aspect,
                            crafting any manner of goods that may be needed. Some are even open to teaching interested
                            Nimbats and Visitants, and help them improve their handiwork.

                    “The Elder of Production is not often spoke of by others, not as a matter of distaste but rather a
                    matter of feeling slightly overwhelmed. Carolyn is passionate, to say the least. They say that once,
                    when she was a kit, she got lost in the North in an adventure on her own, and returned to the Colony
                    years later with a bear skin draped across her shoulders and a barrel of beer under her arm. Despite
                    this harrowing description, she is a very loving sort. Quite the hugger, too—if I didn’t have the
                    air to
                    voice my complaint, she might’ve destroyed my ribs. Her loving nature is juxtaposed with her rough
                    hand,
                    which explains her bulkier frame. Mechanic, smith, sometimes an engineer, and sometimes a drinking
                    champion, the only muscle larger than those in her arms and legs is her heart, which only means
                    she’s
                    more likely to lift you up in a hug! Also, don’t bother asking her about the leg. She changes the
                    story
                    every time you ask.”

                        with this specific set of skills, magical or otherwise, can often be seen weaved through her day
                        to day existence. Even the very grass she walks tends to grow quicker. She can often be found
                        walking about the farmlands, directing and educating workers on nurturing and extracting various
                        crops while she lets her magic weave in and amplify the harvest and its yield. She wears a
                        poncho made of woven string, which was given to her by her Visitant that had passed away years
                        ago. To this day, Kara still speaks of them quite lovingly.”

                        “Perception can sometimes take different shapes and forms. Some Nimbats here know echolocation,
                        others can see souls and read minds, and others still can feel the weave of nature itself in
                        every corner. Vivianne is a rare type, picking up a kind of talent that might have been useless
                        in ages past, when the utilization of metal was not very common. Some scholars in the Colony
                        believe that talents like her ability to pick up electromagnetic and ferromagnetic signals from
                        the planet and the objects on it could be a sign of encroaching evolution. Or maybe, magic is
                        just that flexible. Whatever it’s worth, the feline working in Metallurgy is a bit of a sassy
                        sort, carrying herself around like she’s the very gold of the earth, and only reciprocative when
                        someone seems to believe it. In essence, if you’re nice to her on default, she’s nice to you,
                        usually. Curiously, Vivianne is blind in both eyes, meaning that her ability to sense magnetism
                        and natural magnetic fields is her only real way of seeing. It also gives her an astounding
                        skill in dictating the particles of certain metals, so she could use alchemical processes to
                        transmute.”

                        welcoming experience is that it’s host to a multitude of Nimbats led and guided by a soul who
                        often treats his subordinates with a kindly, fatherly disposition. Mac is a hard-at-work dad,
                        and judging by his looks, one could most certainly make such a guess. Of course, he’s frequently
                        talking about his kids, and one work shift with him could turn into a splurge of photos and
                        stories, yet it’s hard not to smile at how actually compassionate he is. The only sore item of
                        note is his severely-damaged wings. They stay tucked in most of the time, for the entire
                        structure has been singed and torn in places, making flight impossible for him. In spite of
                        this, he proves to be one of the heartiest Nimbats in the Colony.”
