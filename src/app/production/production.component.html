                        are the craftsbattes, miners, loggers, and farmers that keep the whole colony moving together.

                    <h4>Agriculture</h4>This sect focuses almost entirely on the production of crops. Whether it be for
                    food or materials like cotton, the farmers and gatherers are the lifeblood of Agriculture for the
                    Colony. Crops are inspected, and those working on the production and maintenance of these crops are
                    compensated accordingly. There are also systems proposed and practiced by this sect in order to
                    protect food security in moments of disaster or destruction.

                <h5 class="col-md-8 offset-md-2">
                    <h4>Metallurgy</h4>A majority of the workers in Metallurgy are focused on extracting and refining
                    material from the Colony’s mine, as well as those more interested in processing metals for tools and
                    other uses around the Colony. What’s most interesting is that while the mine itself isn’t very rich
                    in ore, the Nimbats that deploy their magics for alchemy are able to transmute stone and other
                    procured items from the mines into potential ore. From there, smelters and forgers are able to
                    process that metal into usable material. They work closely with Preservation’s Maintenance sect,
                    providing them with material that may be needed to retain infrastructural integrity for buildings
                    and other projects.

                    <h4>Handicraft</h4>Handicraft is home to the makers, the movers, the shakers, and the improvers that
                    actually produce the things made from raw material found in its sister sects. Carpenters, weavers,
                    goldsmiths, leatherworkers, blacksmiths and more find themselves at-home in this aspect, crafting
                    any manner of goods that may be needed. Some are even open to teaching interested Nimbats and
                    Visitants, and help them improve their handiwork.

                    of her associates.”<br><br>

                    Attached to this entry is a tape recorder…<br><br>

                    “The Elder of Production isn’t spoken of so often by folks. It ain’t because we find her distasteful
                    or anything, it’s just that she’s kinda overwhelming. I mean, she’s really passionate, that’s for
                    sure. But, like, TOO passionate. I’ve heard some buddies of mine say that her freaking hugs have
                    sent people to the hospital. Like, dude, she’s HUGE. She might break a rib on you, buddy! Oh- Oh,
                    man, you should hear some of the stories about her. They say when she came to the Colony, she had an
                    entire BEAR skin draped over her shoulders, and an entire barrel of beer under her arm. Like, they
                    used to say that when she was younger, she just got lost in the Northern continents for decades and
                    came back like…uh, that. If you know anything about what us Production battes do, then you oughta
                    know what she’s all about, too. Y’know. Mechanic. Smith. Engineer. Drinking champion. The works. Oh,
                    uh, don’t ask about the leg unless you want an over-the-top adventure story. I swear, man, she
                    changes the story every time.”<br><br>

                    “Given the nature of a potential visit with Carolyn, I opted instead to try and gather information
                    on her by proxy to avoid potential unintentional bodily harm.”

Her power and knowledge with this specific set of skills, magical or otherwise, can often be seen weaved through her day to day existence. Even the very grass she walks tends to grow quicker. She can be found walking about the farmlands, directing and educating workers on nurturing and extracting various crops while she lets her magic weave in and amplify the harvest and its yield. She wears a poncho made of woven string, which was given to her by her Visitant that had passed away years ago. Kara still speaks of them quite lovingly, despite her sometimes-downtrodden mood whenever the topic arises.”

                    </h4>“Perception can sometimes take different shapes and forms. Some Nimbats here know echolocation, others can see souls and read minds, and others still can feel the weave of nature itself in every corner. Vivianne is of a rare type, picking up a kind of talent that might have been useless in ages past, when the utilization of metal was not very common. Some scholars in the Colony believe that talents like her ability to pick up electromagnetic and ferromagnetic signals from the planet and the objects on it could be a sign of encroaching evolution. Or maybe, magic is just that flexible. The Nimbat working in Metallurgy is a bit of a sassy sort, carrying herself around like she represents or embodies the very gold of the earth, and only reciprocative when other parties seem to believe it. In essence, if you are nice to her by default, she is inclined to be nice to you, usually. Curiously, Vivianne is blind in both eyes, meaning that her ability to sense magnetism and natural magnetic fields is her only real way of seeing. It also gives her an astounding skill in dictating the particles of certain metals, so she could use alchemical processes to transmute.”

                    “Perhaps one of the things that makes the crafting sect of the Production Flight a more welcoming experience is that it lays host to a multitude of Nimbats led and guided by a soul who often treats his subordinates with a kindly, fatherly disposition. Mac is a hard-at-work dad, and judging by his looks, one could most certainly make such a guess. Of course, our interview had him frequently talking about his kids, and one work shift with him could turn into a splurge of photos and stories. I find it hard not to smile at how actually compassionate he is. The only sore item of note is his severely-damaged wings. They stay tucked in most of the time, for the entire membranous fiber has been burned and torn in places, making flight impossible for him. In spite of this, he proves to be one of the heartiest Nimbats in the Colony.”
