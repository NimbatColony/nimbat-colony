        <h6 style="text-align:justify">
          Flight Preservation deals with the Colony’s impact on the world around them, and the world’s impact on the
          Colony. They work closely with the other Flights to ensure they all are being mindful with their consumption
          of
          resources, and the organization of space. They work especially close with Flight Populace, to ensure they’re
          able to produce enough for Nimbats to prosper, and for Visitants to live without issues. With this
          coordination
          established between both Flights, every inhabitant of the Colony should have their needs to live catered to.
          Should complications arise, problem-solving is situated to the following sects.</h6>

              The Maintenance sect focuses on the primary aspect of keeping Colony resources and infrastructural
              integrity at tip-top upkeep. Before projects can begin, whether it’s Production requiring use of a
              resource or the construction of a new building, this sect refers to its acute knowledge of the purposes of
              roads and building codes as well as the reserves of Colony materials in order to reliably come to
              collected and informed decision-making.
            </div>
            <div class="col" style="text-align:justify">
              This sect is concerned with the use of resources that exist outside of the Colony, and how the Nimbats
              affect the land around them. Whether it be logging, hunting, or potential Colony expansion, the Forestry
              sect is the first to inspect and sign off on any activity that may impact the environment outside of the
              Colony. They are also tasked with forest fire prevention, mostly by clearing the underbrush and felling
              trees as needed.
            </div>
            <div class="col" style="text-align:justify">
              The record-keepers and historians in this sect have procured vast knowledge of the Colony’s lengthy span.
              They do not have events from the outside world well-documented unless it has concerned the Colony in the
              past. The history of the Colony and its related records are created and curated by Scribing with the
              intent of preserving the knowledge of past eras for future inhabitants, be they Nimbat or Visitant alike.
              Artifacts and writing from the past are also kept by Scribing, some of which are on public display.

      <h3>Katell, Flight Preservation Elder</h3>

      <h5 class="notes">
        "Katell is by far the most adorable Nimbat Elder described to me. Short like a dumpling, and wearing a pair of
        big glasses, she’s defined as one of the more “studious” Nimbats in the Colony. Typically buries her nose into a
        book or a report. Apparently she holds a book club–oh, she’s just a nerdy thing! I hope this report doesn’t fall
        into her paws, I don’t mean to embarrass her. Even so, her demeanor isn’t by accident. Being an Elder Nimbat for
        Flight Preservation has put her straight into the more complicated aspects of the very integrity of the Colony,
        from its structures and systems to its resources. Shockingly, she has control over electricity, which she
        personally uses to fuel a number of processes, or shock someone that tries to bully her too much."

              "Artemis is often described as a web-maker. If you ask about something, he knows almost all about it,
              where to get it, and how they use it. If he doesn’t know about it, it probably just got introduced to the
              Colony and he’s already busily incorporating it into his organized “web” of info. His talents in
              organization gave him a surefire election into leading this sect. Supposedly when he isn’t working, some
              say that he secretly enjoys venturing out of the Colony to “see an old friend,” whoever that might be."

            <div class="col notes" style="text-align:justify">
              “Most Nimbats work closely with their sect leaders. Some have a slightly distant approach, treating the
              sect leader like an overseer that puts in orders through others, rather than being a manager that stands
              among their workers. For Titania, she rarely ever sees her fellow peers in Forestry…and that’s for a
              reason. It was a hell of a time trying to locate and interview this Nimbat, and it was even more jarring
              and weary trying to actually talk with her. Titania claims to serve only two beings: the will of the wood,
              and Katell. The former notion is supported by the fact that she is very much a person well-consumed by
              nature. Her fur has flecks of dirt and grass, but it still has the serene freshness and smell of spring
              water and jungle rain. Fireflies often accompany her at night. Her appearance changes with the seasons,
              making her more like a plant than a Nimbat. Some have even claimed that moss could grow on her. As for
              speaking, she seems…distant. Like her attention is focused mostly on something in the air, which she
              regards as her priority audience. You are but a lamb to her, and don’t have that same privilege. It’s as
              strange as talking to a stereotypical seer or an oracle. Even when she makes her monthly reports to
              Katell, she’s just as off-putting. What in Mother Nature does she do in her free time…?”

              "“Thin but wide reading glasses on an older-looking Nimbat that works in Preservation? You know full well
              that she’s gonna be some kind of librarian. What you might not know is that she is the sect leader and
              organizer for Scribing—she seems to maintain a more humble outlook to herself, not perusing around her
              subjects and giving them orders. Instead, she does her work behind her big, clean, cute desk full of
              knickknacks and turned-in books. Many of the writings found in her library are not of human making,
              creating a wondrous opportunity to peek into how Nimbats perceived and recorded the world around them. Not
              just historical accounts, but stories of expression, or fables for children, or personal ramblings put
              into story format. Some of them have even been written by Charlotte herself. Now, as I write this, she
              wanted me to insert a small note:"
              <i class="notes">”While all the “Checking me out” comments were cute the first few times, it has gotten to
                be a bit of a
