            <h5 class="notes">"During my time here, I've come across a number of Nimbats that are considered to be
                "popular," in the words of other members of the Colony. For whatever reason, these Nimbats are known
                beyond the Flights they belong to, despite there being so many of them. I've met a few in person, but
                most tend to be harder to track down."</h5>

                            to still be with Dust, who in a way is her Visitant. Fidget is the first Nimbat that our
                            society had ever come in contact with, and her and her species piqued our collective
                            interest. She was the guardian of the ancient sword that Dust now wields, and originally
                            joined him on his journey because he wouldn't return it to her. Though, I've heard plenty of
                            credible rumors indicating that the sword is sentient, and only travels with Dust because he
                            allows it."</h6>

                            talks about her Visitant quite a bit, a student by the name of Finn, who she reports she
                            more or less became his Advocate before he became her Visitant, latching onto him when they
                            first met. She often spends time outside of the Colony with him, acting more or less as his
                            companion. I've yet to meet this 'Finn', as she says he's quite busy and can't make it to

What is known about her is that she did not originate from the colonies. She is rumored to come from a community far, far to the north and migrated here almost a century ago. Her demeanor has been recorded as being somewhat reserved, focused but amenable (or maybe it’s tolerant) to the antics of others. It has been noted that she can be rather abrasive with her pragmatism. Reconnaissance suggests she doesn’t take an active role with vistants not explicitly related to her field of study. Working as an apothecary who specializes in pre and post-natal care for the colony, it is suspected that she is the most consulted individual when it comes to healthcare needs. Some theorize that she might be a seer due to her failing eyesight and uncanny ability to diagnose her patients with little more than a passing glance, but these reports have not been confirmed.”</h6>

From observation alone, I've noticed that the Nimbat seems to be quite adept in forms of Cryokinesis and Electrokinesis. Almost to the point of being able to manipulate the weather around him. Every time I've passed by him, I always feel as if the temperature around me has dropped.</h6>
                                <h6 style="text-align:left;" class="notes">    Curiously enough, in my small talks with him he's mentioned to me that he wasn't always a Nimbat? If this is true, this changes my previous notes I've made in regards to never having met one; alas he seemed quite busy and I was unable to inquire further. Although I had noticed some small abnormalities to him, including small brown horns, a feather-like tail and other draconic features. A curious creature to be sure, one worth trying to try to talk to again in the future..."</h6>
