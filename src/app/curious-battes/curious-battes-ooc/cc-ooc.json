            "answers": [
                "There are plans for those in the future, yes! They'd likely be outside of the realm of roleplay, so things like movie or game nights for sure. Servers for certain games in the future could be a possibility, but it's not really our priority as of right now. Rest assured, though, no community events would be locked behind patreon subscriptions, unless they involved sneak peeks at future content."

            "question": "Is involvement with the Colony Chronicles just between the elders and anons or do nimbats within the community get their time to shine? If so, does that apply to patreon nims only or is everyone fair game? -Anon",
            "answers": [
                "As for right now, Chronicles are stories that happen between non-player characters, whether that be Elders, Sect Leaders, other Nimbats in the colony, or anonymous/non-anonymous, non-player Visitants. They are, at large, supposed to be looks into every-day life in the Colony, to give members of the community a bit of a look into what I guess could be considered canon.",
                " A note on that: The Nimbat Colony setting is to be used more or less how you, as the player/writer, would like it to be. Colony Chronicles are, in a way, a way to provide you inspiration for your own stories or roleplays. "
