In the event the colony is directly or indirectly attacked, does it fall solely on the individual's ability to cast magic or are there ways to circumvent short comings in those fields? Is there use of traps and artillery or any forms of firearm and melee weapons?",

                "“Assuming you’re just weirdly curious…the Colony has two main ‘modes’ that the Protection Flight practices. Prevention, and Elimination. Very simple to explain. The former has things like illusions, scouting, and internal security to ensure a problem doesn’t happen. If something does, Elimination boils down to Nimbats that are equipped with standardized training and materials, and Nimbats that are specialized in their power output. Think of it as…your military, and then your supers. Is that informative enough? If you were seeking more, maybe you should tell me personally why you want that, and what you’re doing with it…” -Eislyn"

You see, birds evolved with hollow bones and larger lungs in order to maintain a necessary oxygen supply for flying at higher altitudes. By comparison, we’re considered low fliers. Ah, I haven’t really tried to fly further than…say, the top of Big Ben! Of course, there’s some that fly even higher than that, and usually they do have some kind of supplement, magic or otherwise.” -Katell"

                "Ideally, accommodations are provided as direct interventions of the Populace Flight. Personalized education and therapy for neurodivergent, and specialized education for those with categorized mental disorders are applicable subjects that can be acquired through Flight permission. The same goes for physical aid such as prosthetics and vehicular supplements (e.g. wheelchairs.) Buildings do not typically have pre-existing codes to accommodate the disabled due to the building plans being somewhat distanced from human standards (i.e. Stairs are rare, and if goods or persons need to be lifted up a tree, usually a pulley is implemented if wings/magic can do the trick.)",

                "Neither is more common than the other. A Nimbat's capacity for magic is tied to what they're willing to learn, and what strength they already possess.

For some, it's as simple as just having a training day to see if you're fit for the job. Some have volunteering opportunities that serve a similar purpose. Others may have a bit more importance and complication. For example, initiating into the Defense sect, as part of the Protection Flight, requires a specific psychological evaluation from Eislyn.",
